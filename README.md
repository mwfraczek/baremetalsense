# Overview: 🌎
This repository features a **bare-metal I2C driver** and application level code written in **C** for the Nucleo-L476RG. It is designed to read temperature and pressure data from a BMP390 sensor. The purpose of this project is to develop and showcase **low-level programming** skills without reliance on HAL or abstraction libraries - with everything being **configured directly from the STM32L4xx Reference Manual** (RM0351). The goal is to demonstrate a solid baseline understanding of embedded systems programming, along with the various tools required to accomplish the task. 


## Hardware Requirements: 🧰
- **MCU:** Nucleo-L476RG (STM32L476RG).
- **Sensor:** BMP390 Breakout Board - Adafruit or Amazon variants have both been tested and verified to work.
- **Pull-ups:** 2.2kOhm on SCL and SDA. Ideal communication and waveform results may vary dependent on your hardware setup and capacitance characteristics.
- **Power:** PC supplied USB-power to Nucleo board. Nucleo board supplied 3.3V VDD to sensor.
- **Configuration:** SDO tied to GND (slave addr: 0x76). CSB tied to 3.3V (I2C Interface Selection).   


## Build Instructions: 🛠️
- **Install** ARM GCC toolchain: `sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi`
- **Clone** repo: `git clone https://github.com/mwfraczek/baremetalsense.git`
- **Build**: `make`
- **Flash**: `st-flash --reset write bin/main.bin 0x08000000` or use STM32CubeIDE
