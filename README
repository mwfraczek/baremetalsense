PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
This project is bare-metal firmware for reading pressure and temperature data from a BMP390 sensor via I2C protocol with the STM32L496 Nucleo board microcontroller.

HARDWARE SETUP: 
- Nucleo-L496ZGT3 (STM32)
- BMP390 (PB8 to SCL, PB9 to SDA)

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
- Install ARM GCC toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc) on your system (e.g., sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi).
- Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/mwfraczek/flightcontrol.git
- Build project with Make. 
- Flash with STM32CubeIDE or st-flash: (e.g., st-flash --reset write bin/main.bin 0x08000000.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Toolchain: ARM GCC (arm-none-eabi-gcc) GNU Make, objcopy (from binutils-arm-none-eabi).
- Hardware: STM32L496 Nucleo board, BMP390 sensor.
- No external libs, zero runtime deps. STM32CubeIDE optional for debugging.
